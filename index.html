      <p>We train athletes â€“ professional, collegiate, youth, and anybody that wants to train like an athlete. When we speak of training we are talking about speed, strength, power, and sports therapy.
        Our business is aimed at a health conscience adult who wants to move beyond the usual local gym.

      <p>You are always welcome to look through any of our gyms at your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants hustling you on every corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing change from that. Our 'no obligation, no pressure' attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit rate.</p>

      <p>We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an old school feel with a new school attitude!
        We are open 24:7. YOU can now train any time you like, weekdays, weekends & public holidays. WE ARE OPEN! Unlike other so called 24:7 gyms, we are staffed all the time. If you need a late night workout, a protein bar or shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we are open for you. Our class times change constantly so check out on the web site for the timetable at each of our clubs.</p>
